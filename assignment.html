    <h2>BASICS OF CSS</h2>
    <article class="blog">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and design web pages. It controls the look and feel of HTML elements by defining properties like color, font, layout, and spacing. CSS works with selectors that target HTML tags, classes, or IDs to apply styles. There are three ways to use CSS: inline, internal, and external, with external stylesheets being most common for larger projects. Key concepts include the box model (content, padding, border, margin), positioning, and responsive design with media queries. Mastering CSS transforms static HTML into visually appealing, user-friendly websites, making it an essential skill for every web developer.</article>
